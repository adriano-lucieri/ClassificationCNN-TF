<h1>CNN for Classification in TensorFlow</h1> <br/>
This repository provides a basic implementation of a classiciation CNN in TensorFlow which adapts transfer learning methodology for model initialization. The code uses pretrained Inception_ResNet_v2 network for its initialization. Refer to the paper for more details <b>[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07261.pdf]</b>. For training the network on your own dataset, use <b>configureIMDB.py</b> script to setup the dataset or modify the code available in the file <b>inputReader.py</b> to read in the data yourself. Use <b>trainer_incresv2.py</b> script to start training.
